              Diablo 3: Reaper of Souls - Guide
            </h2><br>
              <p>This guide is my information center Diablo 3: Reaper of Souls. I will cover character creation, game modes, resource gathering, leveling, gear and more. First, Diablo lore and history. This game was released on May 15, 2012 by <a href="https://www.blizzard.com">Blizzard Entertainment</a>. The game was very successful as a dungeon crawler and is currently the longest supported online game in history. The game has seen multiple platform generations (PC, Xbox360, XboxOne and Series S/X, Playstation 3, 4 and 5, and Nintendo Switch.) as well as updates, expansions and revisions. The story continues the battle between good and evil in the realm of man. The Schollar, Cain has been studying the the rise to power of the prime angel Inarius and his fall from rule, guided by Malthael, one of Diablos generals. While exploring a cathedral in New Tristram, what is thought to be a comet falls through the roof. As a nephilim (the offspring of an angel and human) your role in the sory is to protect the world from this event and restore order in the heavens and hells. Decide the future and join forces with wizards, demon hunters, crusaders, barbarians, monks, necromancer or the witch doctor.

        <h2>
          Selecting a character
        </h2>
        <p>
          Selecting a character is a personal preference, and each class plays differently than the others. Characters such as the wizard and monk are major damage dealers and are the leaders of the groups. crowd control is a necessity for high level progression in end game, this is managed by demon hunters, necromancers and witch doctors. Lastly, a good team needs to have a support element, this is managed by Barbarians and crusaders. Each class is capable of solo play and progression, however, to get the most out of a group, blending the roles is highly recommended.
        </p>
        <p>The Wizard is capable of tremendous amounts of damage. Bringing forth the elemental powers of Sanctuary. They are guided by 
          the teachings of Vyr, Tal Rasha, Typhon and the Firebird, allowing them access to the most extrordinary power. This class is the most commonly played and easiest to develop in play.<br><br>
          The Monk is guided by spiritual balance and harmony, the monk unleashes a fury of physical attacks that cripple their enemies and leave them confused and stunned. This class is playable as a damage dealer or support role, this versatility makes for the monk to be a vital part of a group.<br><br>
          Demon Hunters seek to defeat all that is evil and force them back into the burning hells. Using a flury of arrows and ranged attacks, along with an affiliation with anamals, the demon hunter is a force to be reconed with. Demon hunters are capable of crowd control or support in bolstering the attack of their allies.<br><br>
          Barbarians follow the guidance and influence of Bul Kathos, the father of the barbarians. Physically towering over all other races in Sanctuary, the barbarian is a brutally strong opponent. Drawing the attention of the enemy to them, they deliver a barage of strikes that cripple the enemy and leave them in fear. While capable of being a damage dealer, this call excells as a support character, bolstering the defensve abilities and attacks of their allies.<br><br>
          Crusaders are those that are the most holy. They live by the glory and honor of the high heavens. They are dedicated to smiting out evil from every dark corner of Sanctuary. These crusaders can deliver the fury of the heavens at close range or with distant deliverance from the sky above. This class is a strong attacker, and a solid choise for support. They are able to use thier abilities to heal their allies and provide them with a boost in damage by bathing thier attacks in the light of the heavens.<br><br>
          Necromancers turn the dead in to an army to do their bidding, leaving a wake of bones and corpses in their wake. This makes them masters at crowd control and managemnt of the battle field, allowing the others to focus on the tougher enemies and put the demons back from wence they came.<br><br>
          Witch Doctors use a form of magic found only in their blood lines that give them tools to manage crowds. This class is phenominal for managing crowds and limiting damage to them by stunning, slowing and fearing their enemy.

        <h2>
          Game Modes
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are three different modes to play Diablo 3. <br><br>
          <strong>Campaign</strong> mode that follows the story of Diablo 3 and the lore of the game. This is the least played mode, however is recommended to play through to understand the true story, if you are interrested in that. This mode is limited to a linear story and is fun to play with 3 other friends while starting a character. There are five acts to progres through, and completion of each quest unlocks gear that makes your character tougher and more resilient.<br><br>
          <strong>Adventure</strong> mode removes the story progression, however, adds:
          <ul>
            <li> Bounties - quick missions in each act, that upon completion award a cache of unique tools for your character. </li>
            <li> Rifts - Challenges that use the maps in Diablo to test the metle of your character. Completion of the rift awards armor and weapons for use in the game and keys to unlock greater rifts</li>
            <li> Greater Rifts - are a true test of the strength of your character and team. These rifts grow progressively more challenging past the limits of the base game difficulty. These award high end gear to those that are able to complete the challenge, along with tracking completions on a leaderboard broken down by class, team size and gear set.
            </ul>
          <p><strong>Season Conquests</strong> are a list of unique challenges that provide a unique challenge for the player. These challenges change each season and can be quite challenging.</p>
          <p>I will cover each of these modes and activities more detail on the <a href="#">Activities</a> page.</p>
        </article>

        <article id="lrg">
          <h2>Leveling, Resources and gear</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Leveling</strong><br>Your character will start each season at level 1. You start with a basic weapon and no armor and have to slay the minions of the hells to gain experience. as you level you unlock unique abilities and skills specific to your character class. These skills can be combined with others that have synergies to enhance their function. You will also unlock access to higher level weapons and armor as you gain experience and levels.<br><br>
            <strong>Paragon Levels</strong><br>Once you reach the base cap at level 70, You start gaining paragon points. These points allow additional ranks in your primary resource, vitality, movement speed, etc. This also allows your character to grow past the base game level cap.
            <strong>Resources</strong><br> These items are needed for enchanting, creating, reforging and converting your gear. These items drop from enemies, can be found in chests, and are given as rewards for completion of rifts, bounties and challenges in the game. Managing these resources can be challenging, however, with the right balance of game play can be done. My recommendation for resource management is to focus on bounties at lower levels to gain experience and level up. This will build your pool of resources early and keep you able to upgrade and strengthen your tools regularaly. As you start progression through rifts, use the items gathered to convert into materials when you get items that you don't plan on using for your build. And lastly, hold on to a few of each item in your gear set for reforging and accidental destruction of your gear.
            <strong>Gear</strong>Weapons, armor and gems are items that your character will need to combat the forces of evil. They range from common to legendary, and are identifyable by color. 
            <ul>
              <li><span class="white">White</span> - common, lowest tier</li>
              <li><span class="blue">Blue</span> - magic, better gear that add magical properties</li>
              <li><span class="yellow">Yellow</span> - Rare, additional magical properties, stronger base stats</li>
              <li><span class="gold">Gold</span> - Legendary, special magical properties, unique abilites for all classes or unique abilities for class specific use.</li>
              <li><span class="green">Green</span> - Set items, 6 or 7 piece groups of armor and weapons that synergize with each other unlocking major bonuses for each class. There are 4 sets obtainable for each class that synergize further with legendary items.</li>
              <li>Item Quality - There are additional factors pertaining to the quality of gear for legendary and set items:
              <li>Normal quality are standard drops with no border and have good stat values</li>
              <li>Ancient - drop with higher stat rolls, and have a gold border. These items can be augmented to add additional attributes.</li>
              <li>Ancient Primal - Drop with perfect stat rolls and are incredibly rare. These items drop with a red border and can be augmented with additional attributes.
            </ul>
            <p>Gear will be further covered on the <a href="#">Gear</a> page in more detail.</p>

      <h2 class="lgr">XP and Leveling</h2>
      <article class=xp>
        <p>When you start your character, you will start at level one, regardless of the mode you chose. Once a player reaches level 70, the base level cap is reached. All xp gained from that point, are added to special Paragon ranks. Each rank is assigned by the player to enhance certain attributes, such as area damage, primary affix, movement speed, critical hit chance and damage, etc. Every paragon rank awards one point to add to an attribute, maxing out at 50 in each, excluding your primary affix and vitality which have no maximum.</p><br>
        <p>In Adventure mode, you start in any act, and are able to explore all maps and areas. Here, XP is gained by completing bounties, participation in Rifts and Greater Rifts. There are also other activites that are instigated through Kanai's Cube (see <a href="#crafting">crafting</a> for additional details) and require specific keys or items to unlock. Each of these activities award XP, gold and gear upon completion.</p><br>

      <h2 class="lgr">Gear: Weapons, Armor, Jewelry, and Tokens</h2>
      <p>Synanomus with gaining levels and experience is the advancement in item and material drops from cleared enemies. Certain types of gear unlocks happen at specific levels. Thus, the more you gain, the more you gain.</p>
      <p>Gear drops in a range of rarity and quality ratings:</p>
      <h3>item Rarity</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><span class="white">White</span></strong> items are the most basic and common. These items do not have any special enchantments or magical properties.</li>
        <li><strong><span class="blue">Blue</span></strong> items are slightly less common, and drop with one magical property, such as bonus xp, bonus gold on kill, or additional durability.</li>
        <li><strong><span class="yellow">Yellow</span></strong> items are more uncommon and drop with two magical properties.</li>
        <li><strong><span class="gold">Gold</span></strong> items are legendary and substancially more rare. These items drop with a number of special enchantments that add to your primary attribute (str, dex, or int), vitality, armor, or life. (See <a href="#enchanting">Enchanting</a> for additional details)</li>
        <li><strong><span class="green">Green</span></strong> items are a part of a set. Set items are considered legendary and have the same type of bonuses as gold items. The additional benefit of the set items is a special ability for each grouping of two equiped.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Item Quality</h3>
      <p>Items of legendary rarity also drop with 3 different quality types. Normal, Ancient and Primal Ancient.</p>
      <ul class="items">
        <li>Normal items drop with a standard card that displays the item stats.</li>
        <li>Ancient items are indicated by a gold border around the border of the item card, these items have better stats, allowing higher defenseive and offensive stats.</li>
        <li>Primal Ancient items are indicated by a red border surrounding the item card. These items have the best possible stats and are incredibly rare.</li>

        <p><strong>Legendary gems</strong> are special gems that provide the wearer is special properties. Each gem is different and can only be socketed in jewelry (There are a few exceptions of this rule). These gems are rewards for completion of Greater Rifts, and are awarded at level 0 and have a single perk available. Each time you complete a Greater Rift, you are able to upgrade them with 3-5 chances. The closer your gem is to the difficulty of the Greater rift determines the success of the upgrade chance. A total of 23 legendary gems are available.</p>
